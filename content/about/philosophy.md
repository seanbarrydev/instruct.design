Today it's easier than ever to learn new things. Open access to information has broken down many traditional barriers. With the right ambition and curiosity, there's little that can stop us from expanding our own abilities in exciting new ways.

At the same time, this presents a challenge. How do we navigate a sprawling landscape that seems a little more vast every time we look? How do we know we're on the right path? After all, while access to information may be limitless, there's one thing that isn'tâ€”our time.

My design philosophy assumes three principles about how we learn in today's ever-changing world:

1. Learning must be useful

2. Learning is a value exchange

3. Learning is self-driven
