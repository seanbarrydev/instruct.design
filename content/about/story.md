## Beginnings

Since I was a kid, I've always been a curious person. I was a decent student, excelling in the classes I found interesting and doing well enough to get by in the rest. I was driven not by recognition or a love for academics but by a genuine interest in better understanding things I didn't know.

I studied Psychology at [Illinois State University](https://illinoisstate.edu) and completed a B.A. in 2008. From there, I worked during the day in academic and clinical settings helping children learn about the world and grow as people. At night I attended classes at [Northeastern Illinois University](https://neiu.edu) and in 2014 earned a M.A. in Special Education.

## Work

### 2015 - 2017

While I enjoyed teaching students, after some time I was reminded of what motivated me as a kid (and what didn't). In 2015, I decided to explore the tech world and joined the customer training team at [MediaMath](https://mediamath.com). I was able to use my background as an educator, designing and delivering training courses (ex. *[Audience Management](/work/audience-management)*) in a field that was both new to me and evolving rapidly on its own.

### 2017 - 2020

In 2017, I felt it was time to branch out and take my next step in the digital media industry and joined IPG Mediabrands' Data and Tech team (now part of [Kinesso](https://kinesso.com)). My role focused on designing learning experiences for agency groups like [UM](https://umww.com), [Initiative](https://initiative.com), and Cadreon (now [Matterkind](https://wearematterkind.com)). The audiences with whom I was working varied from agency customers, new hires, and seasoned employees.

Given this broad range of learner backgrounds, I designed learning expreiences in various formats such as eLearning (ex. *[CCPA Rights Requests](/work/ccpa-irr-elearning)*, *[Leveraging Audience Data](/work/audience-data-elearning)*, *[Media Metrics](/work/media-metrics-elearning)*), interactive resources / guides (ex. *[Digital Campaign Workflow](/work/ipg-campaign-workflow)*, *[GDPR Compliance Guide](/work/gdpr-guide)*), and live training programs / events (ex. *[Cadreon Explained](/work/cadreon-explained)*).

### 2020 - Present

In March of 2020 I joined the product management team at [Amobee](https://amobee.com) to own the planning, launch, and expansion of a new customer training program. Leveraging curriculum design frameworks like ADDIE and Universal Design for Learning, I mapped the program structure and began building multiple courses (ex. *[Campaign Manager Series](/work/campaign-manager)*) for Amobee's customer base.

In August of 2020, I launched *[Amobee U](/work/amobee-u)*. Since that time, the focus has been on broadening the program curriculum, expanding the audience, and delivering new coursework.
