The GDPR Compliance Guide provides an overview of GDPR, background on its intent, and guidance for Mediabrands clients, partners, and employees to comply with its requirements and protect individuals' right to own their personal data.

## Tools

- ### **Adobe Illustrator**
  Due to the dense legal nature of the course's subject matter, it was important to illustrate concepts in a simplified manner. Graphic elements and illustrations created in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) were used to communicate these topics in a relatable way.

- ### **Adobe InDesign**
  One component of the compliance guide is a booklet shared in print and as a PDF. InDesign was used to create a master template with various layouts that included graphics and text descriptions of related topics.
