## Company

[IPG](https://www.interpublic.com/) is a global advertising company with agencies ranging from creative and design groups, to media planning/buying services, and more.

## Project

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) is a data privacy regulation enacted in 2018 that aims to protect the rights to personal privacy for individuals in California. The regulation has implications for a range of businesses both in California and elsewhere. One industry for which CCPA has significant implications is digital marketing.

The CCPA Rights Requests eLearning course is designed to help people across IPG's broad portfolio of agencies understand the purpose of CCPA, its requirements, and most importantly how to respond to individual rights requests in a compliant manner. The course includes reference materials, exercises, activities, and assessments to ensure learners master the concepts required for CCPA compliance.

## Tools

The following tools were instrumental in building this course:

- ### **Articulate 360**
  [Articulate 360](https://articulate.com/360) is a suite of software used to develop eLearning in various formats. It includes tools for designing and producing eLearning coursework, as well as for remote collaboration. One of its core products, Articulate Rise, is used to create responsive course layouts for various devices and was the primary tool for this project.

- ### **Adobe Illustrator**
  Due to the legal nature of the subject matter, it was important to illustrate and simplify key concepts. Graphics and illustrations created in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) were used to communicate these topics in a relatable way.
