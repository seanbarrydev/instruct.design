After the acquisition of Acxiom by IPG in 2018, there was a pressing need to establish processes for engagement and collaboration between Matterkind and Acxiom within the broader IPG agency network. Cadreon Explained consisted of a 2-day workshop summit including presentations, activities, and follow-up exercises designed to help teams from both companies identify new business opportunities. 

## Tools

### **Adobe InDesign**
  Various instructional materials were used throughout the summit, including a collaboration playbook created with [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html).
